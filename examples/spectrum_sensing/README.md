# AI-based Spectrum Sensing Example

## Introduction

This example implements a spetrum sensing application using USRP RF hardware, the NI RF Data Recording API and a YOLO-based image detection model

# Getting Started

1. Install Python dependencies from the parent if not already done
> `pip install -r ../../requirements.txt`

2. Install Python dependencies for this example
> `pip install -r ./requirements.txt`

3. Clone the `Yolov5` repository, e.g. outside of this repository
> `git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5 ../../yolov5`

4. Change the settings of the example using the `TODO` file
